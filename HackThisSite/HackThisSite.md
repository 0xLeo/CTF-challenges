Hackthissite application mission write-ups  

###Description  
https://www.hackthissite.org offers various categories of challenges, one of which is "Application missions". They are related to reverse engineering Windows applications to crack them/ obtain data. I found them entertaining and solved the majority of them. Here I will be uploading the write ups of the missions I found most interesting. I don't want to spoil the solutons so I will try not to post numerical results that lead directly to the answer while maintaining the logic flow of the write-ups.  

###Tools
All tools to solve the missions are free.  
* Disassembler; [IDA Pro] (https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/)
* Debugger; [Immunity Debugger] (http://debugger.immunityinc.com/)/ [Ollydbg v1.10](http://www.ollydbg.de/)
